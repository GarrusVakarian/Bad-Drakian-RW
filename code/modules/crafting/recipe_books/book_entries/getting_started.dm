		<p>Start with a role whose description interests you and whose responsibilities you understand. A quieter town role (like Towner) gives you time to learn with other people nearby. Leadership and specialized combat roles can be very demanding for a new player.</p>
		<p>Read your role and subclass descriptions. Skills affect what your character can reliably do: being able to pick up a tool or weapon does not mean you are trained to use it.</p>
		<p>Before joining, open <strong>Content Toggles</strong> in the character sheet&#39;s upper-right corner to review gameplay, display, sound and content preferences. <strong>Keybinds</strong> is just above it. You can change bindings there if a default is uncomfortable. You can also find these in the OOC tab, at the top right.&#x20;</p>
		<p>Introduce yourself to someone in character and ask where your workplace or a useful service is. You do not need to learn every system before you start roleplaying.</p>
		<p>You can return to this guide through <strong>OOC → Encyclopedia → Getting Started</strong>.</p>

		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Shift-click</strong> to examine. Read the result in chat; equipment tooltips, question marks and Mechanics explanations can reveal more.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Q / E</strong> select your left / right hand. Pressing the key for the already active hand uses the item in it.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Z</strong> drops the held item or releases a held grab.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>V</strong> toggles standing and resting. <strong>X</strong> resists grabs, restraints and other situations you may be able to escape.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>C</strong> toggles combat mode. Check its state before clicking another character.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Sneak</strong> on your HUD toggles careful movement. Use it before crossing wilderness vegetation to avoid triggering ordinary ambushes and maneater grabs. Sneak has no default hotkey; you can assign one in Keybinds.</p>
		</li>

		<p>Right-click and middle-click have context-sensitive actions. Examine an unfamiliar item or intent before experimenting on another person.</p>

		<p>Clicking a wieldable weapon in your active hand can grip it with both hands when the other hand is free.</p>
		<p>Use the appropriate draw/stow binding for a weapon&#39;s equipment slot. Slot bindings and the weapon&#39;s own interactions are listed in <strong>Keybinds</strong>.</p>
		<p>Bows, crossbows and slings need matching ammunition. Compatible quivers and pouches support quick loading; examine the weapon and ammunition container for their controls. A crossbow must also be cocked before loading.</p>

		<p><strong>Set Roleplay Ad</strong>, below Content Toggles on the character sheet, lets you advertise the kind of roleplay you are seeking, including that you’re new and seeking instructions.</p>
		<p>Ask another player (usually in LOOC) for mechanical help when appropriate. Use <strong>Adminhelp</strong> for administrator assistance, rule questions or problems that need mediation. It’s fine to ask admins for help if you’re stuck or dead!</p>

One of these things is berries, which are a good food source if you need one in a pinch. But the catch is that some are poisonous. To test if a berry is poison, bite it once and only once, and if the taste is &quot;Bitter&quot; or anything besides &quot;Berry&quot;, it&#39;s poisonous. One bite will damage your health, but not kill you.<br><br><strong>Water:</strong> Murk, swamp water and sewage are unsafe drinking sources. Rivers and clear water fountains are safe. Select the <strong>Bite</strong> intent (H), and then activate it with MMB, to drink from a source on the map.</p>
		<p>A well and a bucket are a useful source of water. Drink from a suitable filled container using its normal LMB interaction. You might need to swap to the <strong>Fill</strong> intent with 1~4 to fill it with water first.</p>
		<p><strong>Sleep:</strong> To sleep, lie down and close your eyes using the arrows around the eye on the left side of your HUD. A bed or bedroll improves rest. This is the main method of healing health and energy (blue bar), spend by using stamina (green bar).</p>
		<p>Sleep gives access to the dream-based skill progression system.</p>

		<h3>Before leaving town</h3>
		<p>Bring <strong>food, water, a light source, bandages, armor and suitable equipment</strong>. Find someone to travel with, learn your route back and tell companions if you are inexperienced. Wilderness creatures and ambushes can overwhelm an unprepared traveller. Never leave town alone!</p>
		<h3>Sneak before crossing vegetation</h3>
		<p><strong>Click the Sneak button on your HUD before entering grass or bushes.</strong> Click it again to return to walking, or assign a Sneak hotkey in Keybinds. Switching to another movement mode ends sneaking, so check the button before continuing.</p>
		<p><strong>Sneaking avoids the ordinary ambush triggers from crossing vegetation and prevents maneaters from grabbing you when you step over them.</strong> Maneaters can look like grass until disturbed.</p>
		<h3>If a maneater grabs you</h3>
		<ol>
		<li><p><strong>Press X, the default Resist hotkey, to start struggling.</strong> Use Resist, not Yield.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Let the struggle run.</strong> It makes repeated escape attempts automatically, with a better chance after each failed attempt. You do not need to spam X. Avoid moving or starting other timed actions while struggling.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>If the struggle stops and you are still caught, <strong>use Resist again</strong>. Call for help: another character can try to pull you free or break the plant.</p>
		</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Act immediately.</strong> A maneater starts chewing shortly after catching you and can tear off a limb if you remain trapped. Having armor is essential to surviving maneaters.</p>
		<h3>Leeches</h3>
		<p>If loosing blood without open wounds, click the heart in the top left. <br><br>You might have leeches attached to you: You’ll see them in the chat, as clickable links, next to the limb they latched on.<br><br>&#x20;Click them to rip them off. And do it quickly: Leeches are incredibly deadly. <br><br>They can bite you if you swim in murky swamp water.</p>
		<h3>If a fight starts</h3>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Turn on <strong>combat mode (C by default)</strong> when you intend to defend yourself. Without combat mode, parry nor dodge, the main defensive mechanics.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>Hold a weapon you are trained to use, and have it’s hand selected. Suitable armor and defensive equipment matter too. Click on enemies to attack them.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>Watch your stamina and leave room to retreat before you exhaust yourself.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>Use <strong>Resist</strong>, normally X, if a creature grabs you.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>Practice unfamiliar mechanics with a willing partner in a safe place.</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Combat has deep mechanics, such as multiple RMB intents and RMB actions (swapped through Shift-1~6), wrestling, spells and miracles. Shift-click them to see what they do.<br><br><strong>Call for help:</strong> ending your phrase with two exclamation marks (example: “Help!!”) will yell instead, reaching further.</p>

		<li><p><strong>Cannot pick up or use something?</strong> Free a hand, stand closer and check whether you are restrained, incapacitated or already performing an action.</p>
