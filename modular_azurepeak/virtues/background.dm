// Backgrounds: virtue-like picks focused on a character's previous life - skills and starting
// equipment, kept in their own free slot alongside (not instead of) the two normal virtue picks.
//
// Ported from Valmorian-Isle PR #76 (github.com/atomicplan666/Valmorian-Isle/pull/76), which itself
// ported Emerald Summit PR #240 onto the Azure Peak rebase; the virtue-quirk refactor it builds on
// is Ratwood-2.0 PR #2650 (github.com/Rotwood-Vale/Ratwood-2.0/pull/2650). Most of these already
// existed here as ordinary virtues (crafter.dm's blacksmith/tailor/physician/hunter/artificer/mining,
// combat.dm's duelist/executioner/militia/brawler/bowman/crossbowman, utility.dm's light_steps/
// performer/granary/forester/tracker/linguist, items.dm's arsonist) - those are retired in
// modular_azurepeak/virtues/retired.dm in favour of this dedicated per-archetype system so that
// spending a virtue on "some skills and a kit" is no longer necessary.
//
// Deliberate additions on top of the VI port (paid addenda, 2026-09-22):
//   * Tailor's Apprentice and Enchanter's Apprentice got proper equipment-choice packs (VI shipped
//     them with only the tools inherited from the retired Skilled Apprentice virtue).
//   * The fighting backgrounds (Brawler/Duelist/Dungeoneer/Militiaman/Toxophilite) grant guaranteed
//     Journeyman in the skills their retired virtues granted guaranteed Journeyman in.
//   * /datum/virtue/utility/second_background lets a virtue slot buy a second background pick.
//   * Every "bunch of apprentice skills" background prompts for two of those skills to be raised to
//     Journeyman, mirroring the old Skilled Apprentice's journeyman-grade highlights.
//
// Not ported: Emerald Summit's "Portable Smelter" contraption (Blacksmith/Scrapper) and "Scroll of
// Find Familiar" (Rogue Alchemist) - neither the portable-smelter item nor the findfamiliar spell
// exist here. Item paths that had no direct equivalent were substituted for the closest one this
// codebase has (surgery/scalpel/improv -> surgery/scalpel, alchemical/endpot -> alchemical/healthpot,
// cooking/pan/aalloy -> cooking/pan, the bare armor/leather/jacket -> its /artijacket subtype).

/// Backgrounds are a separate free pick from the virtue and virtue_two slots. They share virtue
/// machinery (skills, traits, stash) but are picked, saved and displayed as their own slot.
/// (background_desc, used for the equipment blurb, lives on /datum/virtue itself so the virtue text
/// renderer can read it off any pick.)
/datum/virtue/background

/// Shared helper for backgrounds built around "a bunch of apprentice skills": lets the player pick
/// two of the skills the background grants and raises those to Journeyman. Reads the skills straight
/// off added_skills so every background's list stays the single source of truth.
